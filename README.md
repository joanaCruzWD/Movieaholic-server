# Movieaholic- `README.md`

## Description

This is an app to manage your world of movies, those you already have seen and those you plan to see in a near future. This app will help you to understand which movie do you can easily re-watch or don't repeat it at all, or in other way you can store the movies in a list to watch them later. If you don't want that list so long (in case that you are a busy person), you can as well delete some movies from your list and then if you have a moment can search it again.

## User Stories

- **404:** If I am a user, and I try to reach some page that does not exist it will show up 404 page with a feedback message confirming that's for sure my fault! ðŸ¥´
- **Signup:** In here I can find a place to be a part of this great place, and be recognized when I try to login.
- **Login:** When I'm already a part of this group, I can manage my account, for example, adding a movie for my next friday night or search for one to occupy my sunday afternoon. ðŸŽž
- **Logout:** When I really need to go, I just have to logout. That is a way for the spy not to see anything!
- **Profile Page**: While I'm logged in, I can see my profile and manage it, see all the movies that are available.
- **Add some Movies to my favorite list:** When I'm logged, I can add some movies that I heard about to my list.
- **Edit my favorite list:** When I'm logged, I can edit my favorite movies list.
- **Add comments in my favorite list:** I can add some comments to allow some other users to see what I like or dislike about it.
